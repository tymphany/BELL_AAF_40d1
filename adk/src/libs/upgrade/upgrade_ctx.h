    /*! The flow control scheme using dfu_rx_flow_off and pendingDataReq
     *  is especially needed for DFU over LE where the upgrade data is
     *  packet oriented and the max MTU is 64.
     *  Being packet oriented and smaller MTU as compared to BR/EDR, leads to
     *  more short (complete or partial) messages queued for processing as the
     *  Source Buffer is drained.
     *  Since these messages are allocated from heap (pmalloc pool), its highly
     *  probable to run out of pmalloc pools. So a flow control scheme is
     *  required to keep the queued messages for processing within acceptable
     *  limits. In case of LE, the GATT Source stream size is 512 which can hold
     *  at max 8 upgrade data packets as max MTU is 64. So the acceptable
     *  queued message limit is 8.
     *  TODO: Upgrade library is commonly used both for Host<->Primary upgrade
     *        and also Primary<->Secondary upgrade.
     *        Primary<->Secondary upgrade is always using BR/EDR link and
     *        as such this flow control scheme is not required owing to larger
     *        MTU and upgrade data being non-packet oriented.
     *        Also Host<->Primary upgrade can be over BR/EDR link, in which case
     *        this flow control scheme is not required as reasoned above.
     *        But even if this flow control scheme is commonly applied for
     *        DFU over LE or BR/EDR, this won't radically impact the KPIs for
     *        DFU over BR/EDR.
     *        In future, if need arises to localize this flow control scheme to
     *        DFU over LE then logic needs to be added to distinguish
     *        Host<->Primary transport and whether Host<->Primary upgrade or
     *        Primary<->Secondary upgrade.
